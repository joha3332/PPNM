Praktisk programing og Numeriske metoder
In this repo you will find my exercies of the course.

Each exercise is named like this
    First by a number and possibly followed by a letter to indicate which part of the exercise this deals with. 
    Secoundly, seperated by a underscore ´_´ i have named the exercise with a relvent name, which hopfully describes the topic i covers.

Every exercise has a makefile named "Makefile"
