Praktisk programing og Numeriske metoder
In this repo you will find my solutions to the problems of the course.

Each problem has its on directory, named like this [PROBLEMNUMBER]_[TOPIC]

Each problem is then subdivided into parts a, b and c with they own makefile.
	Except for prob 3, which has a common folder and a single makefile.

All problems involving GNUplot will output "decimal_sign in locale is ." in the command line. 
As this was programmed on a mac with decimal_sign: "," the GNUplot instructions are made to check for the local use of decimal sign.
