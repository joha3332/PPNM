// Exam Question - Johannes Kruse \\

In this folder you will find my solution to my exam problem.

My student ID ends with 60,
so my problem will be mod(60,22) = 16.

Problem 16 is Cholesky decomposition of a real symmetric
positive-definite matrix.

I have made an algorithm which can decompose an appropriate matrix 
into a LLT representation.

Furthermore I have implemented:
- A linear equation solver, based on the Cholesky decomposition
- Calculation of determinant from the L and LT matrix
- And a calculation of the inverse matrix

As a further envestigation of the effectiveness of the algorithm,
I have in the "comparison" folder made comparison of my 
Cholesky-based equationsolver with the QR-based method from prob 2.
