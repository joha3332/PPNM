Bessel functions, first defined by the mathematician Daniel Bernoulli and then generalized by Friedrich Bessel, are canonical solutions y(x) of Bessel's differential equation


\begin{equation}
x^2 \frac{{\dx{}}^2 y}{{\dx{x}}^2} + x \frac{\dx{} y}{\dx{x}} + (x^2 + {\alpha}^2) y = 0
\end{equation}

for an arbitrary complex number $\alpha$, the order of the Bessel function. Although $\alpha$ and âˆ’$\alpha$ produce the same differential equation, it is conventional to define different Bessel functions for these two values in such a way that the Bessel functions are mostly smooth functions of $\alpha$.

The most important cases are when $\alpha$ is an integer or half-integer. Bessel functions for integer $\alpha$ are also known as cylinder functions or the cylindrical harmonics because they appear in the solution to Laplace's equation in cylindrical coordinates. Spherical Bessel functions with half-integer $\alpha$ are obtained when the Helmholtz equation is solved in spherical coordinates.
