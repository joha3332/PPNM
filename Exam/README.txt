// Exam Question - Johannes Kruse \\

In this folder you will find my soulution to my exam problem.

My student ID ends with 60,
so my problem will be mod(60,22) = 16.

Problem 16 is Cholesky decomposition of a real symmetric
positive-definite matrix.

I have made a algorithem which can decompose an appropiat matrix 
into a LLT representation.

Futhermore i have implemented:
- A linear equation solver, based on the Cholesky decomposition
- Calculation of determinant from the L and LT matrix
- And a calculation of the inverse matrix

As a futher evestigation of the effectivnes of the algorithem,
i have in the "comparison" folder made comparison of the my 
Cholesky-based equation solver with the QR-based method from prob 2.
